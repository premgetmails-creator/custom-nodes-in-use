Practical ComfyUI custom nodes focused on fast real-world workflow improvements.
This repo is built for global creators and production workflows, with a focus on practical UX and reliable daily use.

Most Deno nodes include a small green `i` button in the top-right corner for quick node info without leaving the ComfyUI canvas.
The pack also includes lightweight frontend/browser helpers such as **DENO Visual Fold**, the no-install **Video Compare** page, and the **Video to GIF/WebP** converter page.

## Release Notes

Public updates are tracked in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). GitHub Releases should use the same short format, with optional notes hidden in collapsible sections.

## Web Tools

Run these directly in your browser:

- [DENO Video Compare](https://deno2026.github.io/comfyui-deno-custom-nodes/video-compare/) - compare two rendered videos with slider, side-by-side, difference, and toggle views.
- [DENO Video to GIF/WebP](https://deno2026.github.io/comfyui-deno-custom-nodes/video-to-gif/) - trim, crop, resize, and export short clips as GIF or smaller WebP files.

## DENO Visual Fold

![DENO Visual Fold](docs/images/deno-visual-fold.webp)

DENO Visual Fold is a visual-only cleanup helper for large ComfyUI graphs. It is enabled automatically when the latest Deno Custom Nodes package is installed or updated.

Select two or more nodes and a green `Fold` button appears near the top-right of the canvas. Click it to collapse the selected nodes into one compact visual group; use `Unfold` to restore them.

You can also select one normal ComfyUI group and use `Fold Group` to collapse the nodes inside that group while keeping the workflow logic untouched. When two or more groups are selected, the same toolbar adds `Align` actions for left/right/top/bottom alignment and horizontal/vertical spacing.

This is different from ComfyUI Subgraph. Subgraph moves nodes into a child graph, which can be powerful, but it may not be ideal when a workflow depends on keeping `Get` / `Set` nodes or parent-child graph structure visible in the main graph. Visual Fold is meant for simple visual organization only. It does not turn the selected nodes into a subgraph or change the workflow logic.

## Included Nodes

### `(Deno) Resize Box`

Resolution helper and image resize node for ComfyUI.

![Deno Resize Box](docs/images/resize-box.jpg)

Main features:

- `Preset Ratio` and `Manual Input` modes
- common ratio presets
- megapixel-based size calculation
- `divisible_by` alignment
- `Center Crop (Fill)` and `Fit (Letterbox/Pillarbox)` resize modes
- `lanczos` default interpolation
- live ratio preview inside the node
- outputs: `image`, `width`, `height`

### `(Deno) Multi Image Loader`

Minor-upgrade multi-image loader designed for batch guide workflows.

Credit: Inspired by the original workflow ideas from **WhatDreamsCost**, then adapted and refined for the Deno workflow style.

![Deno Multi Image Loader](docs/images/multi-image-loader.jpg)

Main features:

- scrollable fixed-height gallery instead of endlessly growing node height
- drag reorder with stable placeholder insertion
- upload button, drag-and-drop upload, and paste image support
- `Input Folder` browser for reusing existing ComfyUI `input` images
- input subfolder browsing with folder tiles, double-click navigation, and a `Parent` button
- nested input images can be added while preserving their ComfyUI subfolder paths
- newest-first input image sorting based on file modified time
- responsive input-folder thumbnails for smoother browsing with many images
- `Keep Input Ratio`, `Preset Ratio`, or `Manual Input` size mode
- ratio preset, megapixels, divisible-by sizing, or direct width/height control
- resize method and interpolation selection
- outputs: `multi_output`, `width`, `height`
- optional crop or fit resizing during export

### `(Deno) Advanced Image Source Loader`

Advanced image source loader for workflows that need external folders, local file paths, web image URLs, and mixed-size image-list output.

This is a separate advanced node. The standard `(Deno) Multi Image Loader` remains the simpler recommended option for normal ComfyUI `input` folder workflows.

![Deno Advanced Image Source Loader](docs/images/advanced-image-source-loader.png)

Main features:

- keeps the familiar Deno image-loader gallery workflow
- supports existing ComfyUI `input` folder browsing
- supports external local folder paths outside the ComfyUI `input` folder
- supports folder tiles, nested-folder browsing, and a `Parent` button
- supports `URL / Path` input for web image URLs, absolute local image paths, and local folder paths
- supports upload, drag-and-drop, paste, and browser folder upload where the browser allows it
- includes a visible `Paste` button plus normal Ctrl+V image paste
- click thumbnails to disable/enable sources without deleting them
- drag thumbnail cards to reorder output sequence
- the gallery expands vertically when the ComfyUI node is resized
- thumbnails use a masonry-style flow so mixed portrait/landscape references are easier to scan
- `Load Path` reads an external folder directly without first importing it into ComfyUI `input`
- `Upload Folder...` is an optional browser upload/import helper, not required for external path loading
- `recursive_folders` option for loading nested folder images
- `Keep Input Ratio`, `Preset Ratio`, or `Manual Input` size mode
- ratio preset, megapixels, divisible-by sizing, or direct width/height control
- resize method and interpolation selection, including center, top, or bottom crop fill modes
- optional `images` input can chain an upstream image batch/list into the same output stream
- outputs a resized `batch` image tensor for normal batch workflows
- outputs `image_list` for workflows that need per-image list handling
- `Original Size` list mode can preserve mixed source resolutions in `image_list`
- `Match Batch Size` list mode makes `image_list` match the resized batch dimensions
- outputs: `batch`, `image_list`, `width`, `height`, `image_count`

### `(Deno) Image Compare`

Visual A/B comparison node for quickly checking two images on the ComfyUI canvas.

![Deno Image Compare](docs/images/image-compare.jpg)

Main features:

- compares `image_a` and `image_b` directly inside the node
- modes: `Slider`, `Side by Side`, `Difference`, and `Toggle`
- hover-move slider interaction for fast before/after inspection
- visible A/B labels and a `Swap` button for checking either direction
- resizes the internal preview area with the node so portrait and landscape images stay readable
- visual-only node with no output connection, keeping the graph cleaner when the comparison is just for inspection

### `(Deno) Video Compare`

Visual A/B comparison node for videos, built for checking upscale and FPS-interpolation results directly on the ComfyUI canvas. All compositing is pure tensor work — no external encoder. The in-node player draws a downscaled WebP frame sequence on a `<canvas>` on a virtual clock (so A/B stay frame-exact) and plays audio via WebAudio; the files are written to ComfyUI's temp dir and served by the existing `/view` route, then auto-cleared on restart.

Main features:

- `video_a` / `video_b` (IMAGE batches) and optional `audio_a` / `audio_b` (AUDIO, e.g. from VHS *Load Video*)
- modes: `Slider`, `Side by Side`, `Difference`, `Toggle` (freeze-frame A/B flip), plus `Swap`
- hover-move slider, click = play/pause, scrub bar, frame step, speed, loop; hover the preview to hear the selected side
- shared timeline: both sides play over the same duration, so an upscale (same frame count) stays frame-locked while an FPS-interpolation result (e.g. RIFE 24 to 48) just looks smoother at the same length
- node resizes to the clip aspect; wheel and middle-drag are passed to the ComfyUI canvas
- `🏷 Output Badges` toggle: optionally adds A/B + resolution badges to the saved output (off by default; the in-node preview always shows them)
- `comparison`: full-resolution **lossless** IMAGE output of the chosen mode (Slider / Side by Side / Difference / Toggle), ready to wire into a save/encode node such as VHS *Video Combine*

Too heavy to run the node? Use the no-install browser tool: **https://deno2026.github.io/comfyui-deno-custom-nodes/video-compare/** (also linked at the bottom of the node).

![Deno Video Compare - Slider](docs/images/video-compare.png)

![Deno Video Compare - Side by Side](docs/images/video-compare-sbs.png)

![Deno Video Compare - Difference](docs/images/video-compare-diff.png)

### `(Deno) Video Preview`

Drop-in, full-resolution preview for checking real encoded output at any point in a graph. It encodes the actual H.264 video at the original resolution in-process with PyAV (no external process is launched) using `+faststart` so the browser plays it inline reliably, then passes the images straight through — so you can insert it **inline at multiple sampling points** without branching the wire.

Main features:

- `images` (IMAGE batch) in, `images` straight-through out, `frame_rate`, and an optional `audio` input that is muxed into the preview as AAC (tolerant of dict / object / `(waveform, sr)` AUDIO and `[C,N]` / `[N,C]` shapes; if audio can't be used it is logged and the video still previews)
- clean auto-looping in-node player like the VHS preview: no control chrome, **hover to hear audio**, **click = play/pause**, a **Full screen** button, and the wheel is passed through to the ComfyUI canvas
- a compact top-left info badge shows the current preview's resolution, FPS, frame count, and duration
- the node fits the clip aspect and stays fitted as it is resized
- each node reuses one temp file, overwritten every run, so heavy iteration never piles up temp storage
- needs PyAV (`pip install av`); if it is missing the node shows a clear one-line install hint instead of failing the graph

![Deno Video Preview](docs/images/video-preview.jpg)

### `(Deno) RTX Video Super Resolution`

Optional Windows/NVIDIA RTX Video Super Resolution helper node for users who want to try NVIDIA VFX inside ComfyUI without manually hunting for the right Python environment.

This node is intentionally separate from the core Deno nodes. It only imports NVIDIA VFX during upscale execution, so normal Deno node installs do not require NVIDIA VFX. ComfyUI Manager installs the node pack without auto-installing NVIDIA VFX.

![Deno RTX Video Super Resolution](docs/images/rtx-vfx-easy-upscale-node.png)

Beginner install flow:

1. Install or update `deno-custom-nodes`, then start ComfyUI.
2. Add `(Deno) RTX Video Super Resolution` and run it once with an image.
3. If NVIDIA VFX is missing, close every ComfyUI window/process.
4. Click the node's `How to install` button.
5. Follow the visual web install guide: download the ZIP from that page, move it into `ComfyUI\custom_nodes\deno-custom-nodes\tools`, extract it there, and run `install_rtx_vfx.bat` from the extracted installer files inside that `tools` folder.
6. If the BAT asks `Install RTX VFX here?`, type `Y` only when the shown Windows path is inside the ComfyUI app you just closed. If it looks wrong, type `N` and stop.
7. Wait for the green `INSTALL COMPLETE` message.
8. Restart ComfyUI completely, then use `(Deno) RTX Video Super Resolution` again.

For the full beginner-friendly visual walkthrough, open the [DENO RTX VFX install page](https://deno2026.github.io/comfyui-deno-custom-nodes/rtx-vfx-install/).
If a tutorial video tells you to open the `tools` folder after installing from ComfyUI Manager, open `tools/OPEN_INSTALL_GUIDE.txt`; it points to the same current install page.

- [VideoSuperRes Python API](https://docs.nvidia.com/maxine/vfx-python/latest/api.html)

Mode guide:

| If your image is... | Use |
| --- | --- |
| small, low-res, or compressed | `VSR` |
| already clean, but needs a larger sharper output | `High Bitrate` |
| noisy or grainy | `Denoise` |
| soft, out of focus, or mildly blurred | `Deblur` |

Main features:

- uses NVIDIA's official `nvidia-vfx` / `nvvfx.VideoSuperRes` package path
- links from the node UI to NVIDIA's official Video Super Resolution documentation
- shows a compact RTX panel with effect buttons, a separate quality selector, a mode-coach line, and only the resize controls that apply to the selected effect
- single-pass and 2-pass RTX panels pass mouse-wheel scrolling through to the ComfyUI canvas, so normal canvas zoom still works while the pointer is over the node
- installer targets the Python used by the current ComfyUI install
- installer refuses to continue if ComfyUI is still running with that Python
- installer asks before installing into the detected Python
- installer stops if no NVIDIA GPU is detected unless the user explicitly overrides the check
- installer reinstalls `nvidia-vfx` cleanly when the user confirms the target Python
- installer first verifies the normal `nvvfx` package path used by the current ComfyUI Python
- installer uses the ASCII Windows runtime fallback only when the normal `nvvfx` path fails verification
- node startup prefers the recorded ASCII fallback path only when that fallback was actually selected
- if another NVIDIA VFX native module is already loaded from a conflicting path, the node stops and asks for a full ComfyUI restart instead of trying to reload the native extension
- installer verifies that NVIDIA's `VideoSuperRes` effect can actually be created after install
- if NVIDIA VFX reports an unsupported runtime feature, the node shows a readable GPU/driver/runtime-path message instead of a raw stack trace
- if NVIDIA Broadcast/NGX VFX DLLs from another RTX node are already loaded, the node reports that native runtime conflict separately from GPU/driver support
- if another Broadcast-based RTX node works while DENO fails, treat it as a native runtime conflict, not proof that the DENO install is broken
- keeps the installer BAT and ZIP on GitHub instead of inside the Manager package, while the node UI provides a `How to install` button that opens the visual web install page plus a `Copy steps` helper
- keeps a small `tools/OPEN_INSTALL_GUIDE.txt` file in Manager installs so the `tools` folder still exists for users following older tutorial videos
- exposes four clear effect buttons: Video SR, High Bitrate, Denoise, and Deblur
- shows a compact mode coach line that explains the selected effect in plain language
- keeps Low, Medium, High, and Ultra quality as a separate selector
- for Video SR and High Bitrate, supports `Scale`, `Keep Ratio`, `Manual`, and `Preset Ratio` resize choices
- `Keep Ratio` and `Preset Ratio` use target megapixels; `Manual` uses width and height
- exposes `divisible_by` alignment for resizable modes, with `1` as the default so standard video sizes such as 1920x1080 stay exact
- higher alignment values such as `32` remain available when a workflow specifically needs forced multiple-of-N output
- shows `Center Crop (Fill)` / `Fit (Letterbox/Pillarbox)` when a manual, preset-ratio, or aligned keep-ratio resize can change aspect ratio
- `Denoise` and `Deblur` keep the original size and hide resize controls, matching NVIDIA's same-size VSR modes
- shows resize controls only when they apply to the selected effect
- Easy Upscale outputs: `images`

### `(Deno) RTX Video Super Resolution (2 Pass)`

Two-pass RTX finishing node for full video workflows. It can run an optional same-size `Denoise` or `Deblur` pass first, then an optional `VSR` or `High Bitrate` upscale pass.

Example workflow:

- [RTX 2-pass upscale workflow](docs/workflows/deno-rtx-lowram-metabatch.json)

Main features:

- includes both `Low System Memory` and `High System Memory` lanes in the example workflow
- the low-memory lane uses VHS Meta Batch so longer videos can be processed in smaller frame chunks
- uses `VHS_VideoInfoSource` to carry the source FPS into `VHS_VideoCombine`
- preserves source audio through the VHS load/combine path
- useful when finishing actual encoded video outputs, not just testing a single image batch
- outputs: `images`

### `(Deno) LTX Sequencer`

LTX guide sequencer tuned for multi-image workflows.

Credit: Inspired by **WhatDreamsCost**'s LTX workflow approach, with Deno-side adjustments focused on day-to-day usability.

![Deno LTX Sequencer](docs/images/ltx-sequencer.jpg)

Main features:

- works with the batch output from `(Deno) Multi Image Loader`
- auto-fills `num_images` from the connected loader when possible
- keeps the existing sync-style workflow
- allows only `strength` values to break out into manual control when needed
- `bypass` switch passes `positive`, `negative`, and `latent` through unchanged for quick A/B tests

### `(Deno) LTX Model Loader`

One compact loader for the common LTX 2.3 model-loading patterns.

![Deno LTX Model Loader](docs/images/ltx-model-loader.jpg)

Main features:

- `Checkpoint Style`, `KJ Style`, and `GGUF Style` modes
- outputs: `model`, `clip`, `video_vae`, `audio_vae`
- uses ComfyUI's built-in checkpoint / diffusion / DualCLIP loading paths where possible
- uses KJNodes `VAELoaderKJ` for split video/audio VAE workflows
- uses ComfyUI-GGUF UNet loading for GGUF workflows
- includes clearer dependency errors and an audio VAE compatibility fallback for mixed ComfyUI/KJNodes environments

### `(Deno) Easy Model Download Helper`

Preset-based setup helper for recommended model file sets. The first built-in preset is the LTX 2.3 8GB VRAM GGUF starter set.

![Deno Easy Model Download Helper](docs/images/easy-model-download-helper.png)

Main features:

- opens official model links in the browser instead of downloading files in Python
- shows detected ComfyUI model roots and lets users copy the selected root
- supports saved creator presets inside the workflow and restores them from browser storage after a page reload
- supports Hugging Face direct links and Civitai page/download links without Python-side network requests
- checks ComfyUI-registered model folders, including custom folder names from `extra_model_paths`
- can find matching files inside model subfolders when users organize large model libraries by project or model family
- shows target ComfyUI model subfolders so viewers know exactly where files should go

Creator preset link guide:

- Hugging Face: right-click the small download icon next to the target file, choose `Copy link address`, then paste that direct file URL into the preset `URL` field.
- Civitai: copy the model page URL from the browser address bar, paste it into the preset `URL` field, then press the `Civitai` button in the editor to convert it to a direct browser download link. If the filename is not visible in the URL, enter the downloaded filename manually.
- For Civitai pages, do not copy the blue `Download` button link unless you intentionally want to provide a direct API download URL.
- `File name` is used only for the target-path check. It should match the downloaded file on disk, especially for Civitai/API links.

![Hugging Face link guide](docs/images/easy-model-download-helper-huggingface-link.png)

![Civitai page URL guide](docs/images/easy-model-download-helper-civitai-link.png)

![Civitai preset editor guide](docs/images/easy-model-download-helper-civitai-node.png)

### `(Deno) LTX Multi LoRA Loader`

Power-LoRA-style multi LoRA loader for LTX workflows.

![Deno LTX Multi LoRA Loader](docs/images/ltx-multi-lora-loader.png)

Main features:

- add multiple LoRAs in one compact node
- per-slot enable toggle
- per-slot `strength`, `video`, and `audio` strength controls
- per-slot trigger word and LoRA note editor
- copy saved trigger words from the LoRA row
- outputs patched `model` and `clip`
- designed to stay close to the familiar Power LoRA Loader workflow while adding LTX-friendly A/V controls and lightweight LoRA reference notes

### `(Deno) LTX Prompt Guide`

Prompt helper that combines LTX prompt encoding, optional negative prompt handling, built-in LTX conditioning, and dialogue-length planning.

![Deno LTX Prompt Guide](docs/images/ltx-prompt-guide.png)

Main features:

- positive prompt text encoding
- optional collapsible negative prompt
- built-in LTX conditioning with `frame_rate`
- estimates minimum video length from quoted dialogue
- supports Auto, Korean, English, Japanese, and Chinese dialogue estimates
- outputs: `positive`, `negative`, `frame_rate`

### `(Deno) Bernini Prompt Guide`

KJ-style Bernini prompt helper that combines positive and negative prompt encoding into one beginner-friendly node.

![Deno Bernini Prompt Guide](docs/images/bernini-prompt-guide.jpg)

Main features:

- `System Prompt` selector with readable modes such as `Text to Video`, `Image to Video`, and `Reference Video Edit`
- shows the active system prompt prefix directly on the top of the node
- writes prompts in instruction style, for example `Replace the jacket with the shirt from image0. Keep the camera motion, background, lighting, and shadows unchanged.`
- reference modes automatically add a short `image0`, `image1`, `image2` naming hint internally
- collapsible negative prompt section
- negative presets fill the visible negative prompt box; edit that box directly to change the final encoded negative prompt
- outputs: `positive`, `negative`

Note: this node prepares text conditioning only. Bernini visual conditioning still requires a ComfyUI/KJ backend that supports Bernini context latents.
While that backend support is still a draft ComfyUI PR, use `tools/DENO_Bernini_Preview_Backend_Update.bat` only on a copied/test portable ComfyUI folder.

## Why This Exists

These nodes are built to reduce repeated setup friction in actual ComfyUI production work.
The goal is not to chase huge feature lists. The goal is to make the workflows people repeat every day feel faster, cleaner, and easier to teach.
